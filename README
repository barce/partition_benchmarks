edit bmark_config.php with the path to your repo.

to build the tables:
php build_test.php <rows of data> <no. of partitions> <mysql|drizzle>
ruby cass_build_tables.rb <rows of data>
  * since cassandra is a 4 dimensional hash store we're not really testing
    partitions but instead the speed of writes. Currently, in order of
    speed of no. of writes / second: drizzle, cassandra, mysql

to test how fast the partitions are as well as having no partitions
php testDao.php <mysql|drizzle>

Examples:

Writing partitions to a database:
php build_tables.php 5000 99 mysql
php build_tables.php 5000 99 drizzle

On a 2.4 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo with 2GB of DDR3 RAM, drizzle is much faster


Finding data in one of the partitions:
php testDao.php mysql
php testDao.php drizzle

Drizzle is much slower b/c it doesn't have native partitions yet, but on
regular selects with an index it is faster than mysql.
